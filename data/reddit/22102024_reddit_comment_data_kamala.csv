Reproducive freedom is just another nice way to say baby killing. Americans like to make up neutral sounding words for uncomfortable things.



Abortion is a major issue as the supreme court overturned a previous ruling that essentially made abortion legal on the federal level (meaning all states had to comply with it being legal).¬†


The Supreme Court, in overturning the prior ruling, now makes it so individual states can make their own laws related to unborn baby killing. Also on the federal level, the congress can now make their own laws on making killing unborn babies illegal or totally legal across all states, but most legislatures won't touch it as it is too contraversal, and they are more interested in engaging in corruption to get into something that might cost them voters.¬†


So really it just is a state issue now.¬†


Kamala is campaigning on the issue, though she not only isn't competent enough to make this happen, she'd be dreaming if she thinks she could get that through congress.¬†

And what is that, really? We're going to make an entire person's existence a punishment because a poor woman made one stupid decision, possibly without even having been educated about birth control? That's a shitty thing to do to both people.

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,lrz5xye,15-Oct-2024,1,"I think a president who had been in the criminal justice system would be better placed to care about and reform it. 


The US has built the largest prison state humanity has ever seen. It‚Äôs one of my top political issues. 



I‚Äôve never done time, but I‚Äôm a former prosecutor and current defense attorney. When I became a prosecutor (which I quit after 8 months of arguing with judges why people shouldn‚Äôt be sentenced to jail/prison) I tried to find a program to where I could spend a week in jail so I knew what it was like before I sent people there. Nothing existed. 


The president‚Äôs main job under the US constitution is essential the top prosecutor (enforce the laws of the US). Someone who had spent time in jail would be better equipped to reform the system because they‚Äôve actually been in it. Plus, I don‚Äôt really trust people who didn‚Äôt break laws in their 20s. 


I definitely don‚Äôt think having been convicted of a crime should be disqualifying. I‚Äôm sure most of our presidents have committed tons of felonies, Trump‚Äôs the only one who has been convicted. The average American is unfortunately not as privileged as Trump or me. 


Also, wanna know something horrible, most Americans have never heard of Debs. It‚Äôs shocking. I hand out copies of his sentencing speech on May 1st every year. Because most Americans also don‚Äôt know that is a holiday in the rest of the world or why.


Edit: one more thing about Debs. If he was alive today there‚Äôs a good chance he would have been brought up and convicted of BS charges for organizing protests against police brutality. I don‚Äôt see anytime Debs could have existed in the US and not eventually end up imprisoned for his activism. Times haven‚Äôt changed that much.",lruaoe7

When people like Cheney and the entire media (except FOX of course), big tech, hollywood are supporting her, and actively trying to convince people that Trumps bad.. shouldn't that be a red flag?

Are you not aware that the reason you hate Trump is because everyone told you to? Can you at least admit that the media and reddit mods running attacks on Trump non stop has influenced you in some way?

There's still people out there who believe Russian collusion was real after CNN was reporting it daily for 3 years (and in the end it was completely fabricated lies) while thinking that the Hunter Biden laptop situation was completely not a big deal. There's literal emails showing collusion with foreign countries but because it's the Biden family it's not mentioned in the news, CNN ignores it, etc.

.. That just blows my mind. So their candidate is the one doing the Ukrainian collusion, and were in all likelihood using the Ukraine war as a giant money laundering machine for the democrats, and they claim it's the other way around.

If you didn't consent to the pregnancy I don't believe you should carry it if you don't want. Fortunately, some rape victims do willingly choose to carry to term which is great for them and the baby ofc.

In my perfect world, it shouldn't even be acceptable to be hooking up willy nilly. Idealy you should wait to have sex with a partner that you love and want to marry, that'll would prevent a ton of unnecessary hardships, but we know that's not likely in this current world. Soo. If you are selfish and irresponsible then that's on you, you should've thought about the consequences more before you did it. Hopefully they'll end up alright, I mean I'm an unplanned baby and my parents are good and so am I, I'm sure there will be some cases where the parents won't do a Good job but at least that baby had a chance to become a person. 

That's extremely rare and idk if there is a way to test if they had truly taken contraceptives or not but tbh, birth control pills, condoms, and other contraceptives are not a 100% guarantee, and if a sperm cell is tough enough to swim through and fight those toxic chemicals or w.e. to fertilize an egg then I feel like they should live. They won, they persevered, That baby is definitely gonna be a gigachad.

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,lrvlktf,14-Oct-2024,1,"> Roe V Wade was in place when Obama was President

Obama, on his first term, promised to enshrine RvW, meaning if enshrined it would need either a supermajority or a constitutional amendment to overrule it, which is really hard to do. Obama spun on his heel, in some half-assed attempt at ""working with the other side"".

> Also, Obamacare did a great deal for women‚Äôs rights.

Obamacare did a good deal, yeah, but did not do nearly enough for everybody. I mean, in the midwest there are *still* dental jamborees for people with simple tooth decay (or worse) go to get their teeth fixed, cuz they can't even afford to look up the name of a dentist.

> Also, the worker‚Äôs unions are out there working to get Harris elected.

Not all: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) are sitting it out. Dockworkers also sat it out, citing in fact that Biden was the first Democratic President in 150 years to break a strike in favor of the employer. Chris Smalls, the first president of the Amazon Labor Union has not said anything favorable for Democrats, as Biden didn't say a word when the *fucking Pinkertons* rolled in the Amazon warehouses.

> Do they think Dems only provide lip service to the working class? Do Reps not?

The issue are not the Republicans, cuz the Republicans are a known quantity of *asshole*. We know they don't give a rats ass about workers. If you can respect them for anything, you can say that they are honest about wanting to screw up the working class.

The problem is the Democrats, like Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cory Booker, Nancy Pelosi, who say all the right things, then turn around and go against working class interests.

* [Joe Manchin, blocking of the Build Back Better Act](https://jacobin.com/2021/12/joe-manchin-build-back-better-biden-democrats)

* Kyrsten Sinema, [voting ""no"" on the $15/hr minimal wage](https://youtu.be/nNo_U7PTGzk)

* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, refusing to condemn the genocide in Israel, contrary to what Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar did*. In fact, [the Democratic Socialists of America, cut down ties with AOC over her refusal to oppose* funding of Israel](https://www.dsausa.org/statements/status-of-dsa-national-endorsement-for-rep-ocasio-cortez/) . And while we are talking about healthcare, let's remind ourselves how [AOC refused to push for a row call for M4A](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/keggij/aoc_claims_actual_m4a_grassroots_organizers_are/)

* Cory Booker, in 2017, [voting against importing cheaper drugs from Canada](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/12/cory-booker-joins-senate-republicans-to-kill-measure-to-import-cheaper-medicine-from-canada/) cuz it went against the financial interests of pharmaceuticals from New Jersey.

* Nancy Pelosi... yeah she needs her own book but we will stick to [""Democrats are capitalists and that's the way it is""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR65ZhO6LGA)


So, forgive me, but I don't have any faith in the Democrats^1 , especially since their current re-incarnation refuses to condemn the *obvious* genocide happening in Palestine. And double so, when at one point they say ""As a party we don't mandate a block vote on issues"", and then they try to browbeat Ilhan Omar for voting with her consciousness when it comes to arming Israel.

They don't do sex change surgery on kids. They go through an extremely lengthy process to make sure the kid genuinely wants to transition.

If he's at or near puberty age, then they give him meds that delay puberty. If they change their mind, they take the kid off the puberty blockers and they go through puberty like normal. No harm done, except they'll be a late bloomer. 

If he still is enthusiastic about transitioning, then once they're in their late teens, almost always 18 or older, then they will start them on hormone replacement therapy.

Those women do nowadays form a strong movement that educate people on the reality behind abortion that factually is more dangerous to the physical and mental health of pregnant women than giving birth is. If you try to indicate that I'm interested in oppressing women, I beg to differ. I appreciate women and wish them total autonomy over their body. No women should become pregnant if she doesn't want it. That's something I stand behind 100%. Abortion should never be the way to achieve this though since it kills a human and makes the mother suffer, instead of actually granting the women autonomy over her body. Autonomy to not have a child is to be able to not get pregnant if not wanted. Autonomy to not have a child shouldn't cost a life and the health of the mother.",lrxazjx

40 of 44 of trumps cabinet appointees will not support him for president again, publicly.

Numerous National Security advisors for him will not support him for president again, publicly. Some of them call him dangerous.

His vice president refuses to endorse him, and is not running  with him. Trump explained when asked on a recent interview he was not with him because he wasn't willing to go far enough in his fake elector plot. Go watch it if you don't believe me.

Numerous generals, including a 5 star general, refuse to support him and call him dangerous.

I can keep going and going and going. These are people that, by and large either have a history of never saying these things and working with both parties for many years, or are lifelong republicans and were trump supporters.

These people interacted with him regularly in person, in the actual business of running the country.

Thats not even counting the list of people that were once huge trump supporters that worked for him in some capacity that are also saying the same things, that were not in the white house itself.

His wife and his daughter and her husband who were all over the place with him before have extremely limited appearances with him anymore and especially so with relation to anything political.

We know for a fact Kamala Harris and the Democrats are trying to ban child marriage. Contrast that with Republicans like Jess Edwards who said on the House floor that 12-year-olds are ""ripe and fertile"". Yet another reason why we can't allow Republicans near our families. Republicans will sell a 12-year-old to a 50-year-old for sexual pleasure. And the Republicans who aren't pedophiles will still sell the 12-year-old to a 50-year-old for a tax break. Republicans will traffic a child for money. That is how morally repugnant they are. Whether they snatch a child and sell them on the dark web, or do it by making it legal for to 50-year-olds to get a certificate to rape a 12-year-old, either way Republicans condone child rape proudly. 

And then they wonder why they aren't allowed at our homes, we don't hire them, we don't go to Republican-owned businesses, we don't enter into contracts with people who think that alternative facts are reality, we don't even let Republicans mow our lawns anymore because who knows what that person might do?

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,lruke8b,14-Oct-2024,5,"So in other words you think it's appropriate to use human lives as a punishment for having sex. That's pretty fucked up. 

The average person seeking abortion is a mother in her late 20s who can't afford to have another child. The father might even be the exact same guy as who fathered their existing child! That's not a rando hookup, that's a couple with a healthy sex life where something went wrong and they weren't as protected as they hoped. 

Since you brought up rape expections, what happens in over half of the cases where the rape isn't reported? And how do you think people will be able to get abortions when it usually it takes over a year for sexual assault cases to go to court? And how are people supposed to report rape when they might not know that term applies to their experience or if they still live and depend on their rapist for housing? 

If you hate people having hookups, why do you want those people to procreate? I think seeking an abortion to end a pregnancy that's not wanted or one that would cause major financial issues is incredibly responsible and owning up for your actions. 

""Hopefully they end up alright"", but what if they don't?  Especially in a country like the US without free medical care, where minimum wage is laughable and labour protections barely exist. If you want more children to be born, you should stop looking at abortions and judging people going through them and focus your energy into making it possible for people to have children safely and without bankrupting their families. This is even without mentioning the maternity mortality rates, which are soaring in the US.",lrui2ok

It‚Äôs silly to think that 16 year olds won‚Äôt attempt to stick the p in the v amirite? We should at the very least equip them with the knowledge of the consequences of unprotected sex. Some of these idiots out there actually think they can control teens‚Äô genitals and what they do with them. Both gross and weird if you ask me.

Also it would be super cheap and immensely effective to just hand out contraception.

To me, with proper sex education and contraception we could easily derail a huge percentage of teen pregnancies before conception even happens.

Also, with proper sex ed started at an early age, we may even get a larger benefit. Young children that are taught to identify inappropriate touching can help to identify and prosecute child molesters.

It‚Äôs more common than you think, and I don‚Äôt for two seconds believe a thing the trump campaign says, especially when his party is *constantly* pushing for harsher penalties for performing abortion, resulting in less people seeking medical treatment they need, and less doctors willing to provide the medical treatment they need.

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,ls1peji,15-Oct-2024,1,"Ah yes, because giving women agency over their bodies is the same thing as taking away choices.

People don‚Äôt get abortions because it‚Äôs cool and convenient, and they can take a toll. You know what else takes a toll? Needing an abortion and not being able to find a doctor who is willing to perform one because of hostile anti-choice laws.

Giving people choices does not take choices away. I‚Äôve heard this argument before and it genuinely sickens me to think of someone getting denied care because some cis boy thought the prospect of legal and safe abortions were too ‚Äútempting‚Äù and would deprive women of the luxuries and wonders of motherhood when you know damn well that the REAL decision that shouldn‚Äôt be taken likely is the decision to bring a whole new life into this world.

According to the cdc, [only 2% of all abortions consist of medical complications, with 0.45 deaths per 100,000 women.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430793/)

The Black unemployment rate dropped to record lows under Trump, Black household income rose to a historic high under Trump. He didn't start a war. He cut government spending significantly. He introduced a Hospital Price Transparency Rule which would have made hospitals provide publicly available price lists for common surgeries so the free market could do it's thing and insurance companies would have no longer been able to negotiate better deals than individuals. He was making energy cheaper by bringing in the Keystone XL pipeline which the Democrats killed as soon as they got in office. He correctly killed the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement which would have made America poorer and actually hurt our democracy by giving corporations exclusive rights and special courts to subvert our *national laws*. He introduced opportunity zones which brought much needed investment to low income communities, which worked and it's why black median income went up historically under his administration.

You decide to drink alcohol every day you become an alcoholic, if you decide to rob people eventually you'll get caught and go to jail, if you invest in the Chinese stock market you'll eventually lose your money, if you letting a baby live is a punishment, compared to abortion, letting a baby live is definitely the lesser of two evils.

That could be a possible scenario but again, that shouldn't justify the mass murder coming from the people who would potentially abuse the system. 

If you get raped, you can go to the hospital and request further assistance, be it an abortion and medical care for trauma. I understand it can be a traumatic experience and some people might be in shock or denial or whatever they might be feeling but the reality is that, if they don't ask for help nobody is gonna know they need it. Also You're kinda asking very nuanced questions that I'm not able to answer atm.

So you're saying that it's better to kill someone than to pay bills? Where do we draw the line then? Should we also kill our bed ridden family members? What about mentally handicapped people who can't survive without a caregiver? What about babies after they're born? They aren't viable without an adult is it okay to kill them if the parent decides they don't want that responsibility? When we start believing as a society that one human life is worth less than the other you tend to get major disasters, that's how nazi Germany, Apartheid, slavery, and stuff like that started. I don't want that for the future, that's why I believe it's evil to let a baby pay for the mistakes of their parents. Abortion is murder. 

What if? Well unfortunately that's the reality of life, it's gonna happen, but to pretend that there isn't any programs to help couples with pregnancy is pretty ignorant.

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,ls61v1y,16-Oct-2024,1,"1. Your own source states 0.6 instead of 0.45 as claimed by you. 2. Your own source clearly explains that the mortality rate of abortions in the US is NOT based on mandatory data. Look at how the mortality rate of giving birth is calculated. Most birth-related death are prior or post birth. Considering that most women who have an abortion don't tell many people about it, and considering that these abortions don't have to be stated to any public agency in most US states, most abortion related deaths that happen post-abortion will simply not be included in any data on the subject. Very different to women who have birth and die after that. So you are comparing apples and pears. 3. The US birth mortality rate IS HORRIBLE. It's by war worse than in any other developed nation. A normal one of a developed country  is between 2-5 and therefore below the more likely 6 for abortion stated by non-government researchers. 4. Only 3% of abortions is are done because of fear for life and rape. The rest is done because of mainly not wanting children, financial hardships and non-life threatening health concerns. 5. Honestly I could argue with you about how most pro-lifers and pro-life laws around the world always keep the option for abortion to safe the mothers life. But no need for that as I simply don't think it should be legal in that case either. I don't think any life should ever by lost to safe mine and I don't think a babies life should be lost to safe its mother's. I risked my life various times to help safe others. I'm not ever gonna involuntarily sacrifice someone else to safe my own skin. That's morally wrong in my world and I'm all against prohibiting it. A pregnancy should only happen if dad and mom choose to want it. If they voluntarily choose to get a child they should always put the life and wellbeing of the child as priority number one OR they should give it into the care of somebody else. They shouldn't ever sacrifice the child for their own wellbeing. That's unnatural, wrong and sinful. If you disagree, you disagree. But you won't change my mind on that.",ls1peji

We had 8 years of Obama, and then Trump came along for 4 years, finally Biden's been around for another 4. Here's my question: how long do you think it takes economic policy to make an impact? 1 year? 2 years? 4 years? If it's 4 years all your arguments about economy are basically screwed, and all the bad stuff from Biden basically came from Trump. I think honestly it varies by policy, and it's a lot harder to tell how presidential policy affects the economy than you make out.

Hell, if we're playing interpretation games, I can make an argument that most of the problems we face in 2024 have to do with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated fallout. And if you're trying to preach any sort of objective reality, at least acknowledge that the pandemic put millions of lives at risk and we can go from there. The hospitals were overwhelmed for God's sake. So, you've got a global pandemic, shit is shutting down because people gotta isolate, so the best solution is to vaccinate up and eliminate the virus like we did with smallpox, right? Except your guy Trump is telling people the virus is fake, or the vaccine is fake, spewing out misinformation like a faucet (which he hasn't stopped doing!). The pandemic lasts at least a year longer than it would have, and the national economy suffers. We're still dealing with the fallout. But sure, everything wrong with the economy is the incumbent's fault.

Anyway, none of that matters if our literal democracy is at risk! If the only argument you can make against Trump's aspirations to be a dictator is that the Democrats are already dictators and that Harris voters are totally brainwashed, you are aware that the same argument can be used against Trump voters, right? Anyone can call anyone else a brainwashed idiot supporting a power-hungry regime. The problem is that Trump is explicit about how he's going to take over the country and what will happen afterwards, and people are still going along with it. Rich people, racist people, unapologetic elite authoritarians who want to transform the county into something you and I won't recognize as America. Do you imagine you'll survive the ensuing revolution? Do you imagine your new overlords as more sympathetic? What about the black folks you so generously acknowledge?

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,lrupc6s,14-Oct-2024,3,"Fucking yikes, you're literally comparing abortions to genocide now? You really need to get a grip on reality. 

If you don't want an abortion, don't have one. No one is making you. But calling people who are seeking healthcare murderers because you think a clump of cells or a fetus that cannot survive outside its carriers body takes importance over everything else is in fact evil. 

And that is the difference. An embryo, zygote or a fetus can not survive outside the womb no matter how much medical professionals try to intervene. It's not a person, it has the capability of being a person one day but at this state it is not a person. An acorn is not a tree. 

Pregnant people aren't incubators, pregnancies happen under all kinds of circumstances and the choice is always with the pregnant person. Because their body would be going through ten months of changes and possibly symptoms that are bad enough to stop them from going to work. Then there's the recovery period after birth which can take anywhere from months to years. Or even leave the person with life long disabilities. 

The situation is incredibly bleak and it's so ignorant of you to assume that those government programs are enough when there are seven million families living in poverty in the US. Acting like giving up a child to adoption is a solution to unplanned pregnancies is ignorant as hell and supports a system that is preying on poor people to have children they can't afford to keep. Not to mention that those families and people are left on their own after the adoption if there have been complications in the pregnancy that leaves the pregnant person with disabilities postpartum.",lrunet2

It doesn't matter how many children they've had, or how healthy they are, miscarriages just fucking happen. **Clearing a womb of a miscarriage is considered an abortion. Some women can pass them naturally, but a lot of women need medical intervention or they risk getting sepsis and dying, along with becoming infertile IF they survive.**




Imagine you needed to pass a kidney stone that required surgery, but the doctor was afraid the government would send them to prison for performing the operation. It's insane.¬†

You don't need to be an economist to see what that did or how much groceries now cost. It destroyed equality and the cost of living in this country, all under Democrat leadership. Everybody knows it except for the blue voters who have all convinced themselves the economy is doing great. 

They literally stole poor peoples wealth by printing our money away and gave all of it to rich people in the stock market. And managed to convince all of you that they are somehow fighting inequality. Only someone with a completely brainwashed cult-like faith could reconcile that mentally if they actually thought about it. Personal median wealth adjusted for inflation the last few years goes down for the bottom 90% and goes up for the top 10% because it's corporations and the elites that control the Democrat party. The top 10% love this. They own real estate, or have a big paycheck and $25 deli sandwiches don't bother them. Trust me bro, they care about the little guy, and abortions, they are so moral. Reproductive rights are great because it costs them nothing to make you feel emotional and vote for them. Meanwhile they steal from the working class, your rents now doubled, they send money to Ukraine and won't even provide the free healthcare they have been promising everyone for over 40 years. Oh, but they will provide healthcare to illegals with arrest warrants that jumped the border. And then they wonder why the maga voters are ""so dumb"" to vote for anyone else.

And they have you convinced the people who are against all that are the brainwashed ones, which is really quite genius.

Literal democracy is at risk! Yet nobody voted for Kamala and now we're all pretending like that never happened. It's convenient to the Democrats to hold onto power so it's fine. All the rhetoric you're speaking would be quite convincing if we haven't already seen 4 years of Trump and 4 years of Harris. We've seen their track records already, we know who they are.

I explained why Democrats aren't accountable, it's because Trump is seen as worse and people are voting for the lesser evil. If republicans could actually come up with a better anti-establishment candidate that didn't threaten so many people, maybe the Dems would see the writing on the wall. 

We could go back and forth for ages about the causes of inflation. My understanding is that inflation is fundamentally what happens when demand outpaces supply. What could have caused supply to drop? I think maybe a massive global pandemic that disrupted production lines could have an effect on that. Oh, wait, we did have one of those under Trump. Just because the US Mints are forced to print more money due to economic conditions doesn't mean that the incumbent administration is directly responsible.

But these economic issues aren't the main thrust of my argument. I've made my view clear that the economy is immaterial in the face of Trump gaining power and transforming the US any more into a dictatorship. I read the Project 2025 literature before the media ever picked it up, and it scared the hell out of me. Why doesn't it scare you? You know that Trump lies, I think you even acknowledge it at some point.

Oh, and we all knew that a vote for Biden was basically a vote for Kamala. Would you really have said anything different? Not because she was secretly running everything (the vice president is basically a figurehead and you and I both know that), but because we all knew Biden was old. And yes, both the Trump and Biden teams should be held accountable for denying the reality that their candidates are mentally ill seniors. At least the Dems worked behind the scenes to get their guy out. With Biden in power and unwilling to give it up it was an impossible Catch-22.

Finally, I never called you dumb for voting for Trump. I never called you brainwashed. You are probably voting for the guy with eyes wide open. I just remain unconvinced that you really think Dems are the only elitists in politics. I'm trying to get real here.

.. Well let's be real we all know that was to do with him dying in the polls right. They'll do anything to win.

I wouldn't say Dems are the only elites, i'd just say the majority of the establishment supports them because they are so deeply in bed together. 

I guess what I'd like to ask democrat supporters is why is it such a bad thing to vote in an anti establishment candidate like Trump sometimes to shake things up a bit? If I have a toilet that's leaking into my living room I need any plumber that can get the job done right now! I don't care what kind of guy he is, i'm not looking for him to marry my daughter. I need a guy that can help me quickly fix the damn toilet.

Trump was the wrecking ball the unheard majority wanted to have their voice heard and instead of having their voice heard, the dems called them deplorables and love to float on their cloud of judgement and morality and look down on the uneducated low class trash that are 'dumb enough to fall for the con man' .. üôÑ

Bryan Cranston campaigning for Kamala Harris in Arizona yesterday,1g34hu5,ls8yyld,16-Oct-2024,1,"Thank you for being responsive and engaging with me in a more positive way! I confess I didn't expect that kind of response, so I didn't check my notifications until days later. I'm sorry for underestimating you.

I agree with you about Trump being the wrecking ball, the anti-establishment candidate voted in to shake things up. I get the appeal of that, and I think our political system needs some changes to get away from the two-party model. But the fact is that Trump was already voted in as president, and he should have already accomplished that goal! The thing I like about a plumber is that they come in, get the job done, I pay their fee, and they leave. Whether the price was a bunch of money, or a bunch of insults towards my family and friends, I know the guy will take his profits and never bother me again. Tell me, what would Trump fixing the political landscape actually look like? I don't think that MAGA Republicans will ever say exactly what the end goal is, because if the Democrats actually manage to get it done, then it's egg on their face, and the Democrats gain power. I think this is why Trump made a call to Republicans to block that one immigration bill. He doesn't actually want to fix anything.

You could say that the Democrats are just the same way, and that Trump getting voted in won't force them to change anything. But I think that Kamala Harris indicates otherwise. The propaganda argument is that she's a black woman and you should vote for her just because of that. I think it's more than that. The Democrats actually never expected her to be up for president, even after Biden chose her as VP. Why do I think that? Because they gave her jobs that were practically designed to give her a bad name. That whole ""border czar"" assignment was just to save face in the wake of an immigration crisis, because the VP has no power to do anything about it! All she could do was make speeches and cast a single vote in the Senate to break ties. She was put there essentially as a sacrificial lamb to take the blame so Biden could get reelected.

But then Biden started showing signs of age, just like Trump did. Except the Democrats have a lot more trouble justifying an old candidate, because they were forced to oppose Trump and his cult of personality. The presence of Trump along with Biden's mental state has forced the Dems to make Kamala their nominee, despite the fact that she's not as well connected as the rest of them. Once you look past all the propaganda about her sleeping her way to the top, you find a politician who did her job reasonably well when she actually had any power, without all the connections that the rest of the party have. She's not perfect, but she's certainly no Hillary Clinton. That's the shakeup that Trump caused. MAGA will try to convince you that nothing's changed, but I truly think this is a big blow to the Democrat establishment.

In regards to Trump being a dictator, the thing that really convinced me was the Jan 6th riots. If Trump supporters truly saw him as a wrecking ball, they would have been fine with him getting voted out in 4 years. Instead what we see is this insane rioting at the very center of our government over election fraud? This is what dictators do, they rile up a small base of rabid supporters (here I'm talking about the really gung-ho MAGA folks, not the average Trump voter), that will do literally anything they say, and then they try to gain permanent power in any way they can.

I can't believe any of this election fraud stuff is real, mostly because Trump has been massively unsuccessful at proving anything in court. You could argue, as he does, that the court system is rigged against Trump. But if you listen to an actual lawyer analyze any of his court cases, it seems like he doesn't even want to win them? His lawyers are unwilling to cooperate with the courts in any way, and even Trump-appointed judges are forced to dismiss Trump's cases because of basic court misdemeanors. Except when Trump's being prosecuted, in which case he does everything he can to make his own case worse. And then Trump immediately turns around and says he's being suppressed. Since when does a Republican act this way? No wonder there's riots in all the big cities. Neither party has respect for the justice system anymore.

The other thing that makes me call Trump a dictator is Project 2025, or the Mandate for Leadership written by the Heritage foundation. Now you might say that the Heritage foundation has no link to Trump, and that Trump has publicly disavowed their policies. But the fact is that the Heritage foundation is doing a lot of really hard recruitment efforts amongst the alt-right, and they intend to get those people in key government positions. Trump intends to transform the executive branch, especially the Justice department, by turning a bunch of positions into presidential appointees. If Trump is presenting with a nice recruitment list by a big conservative organization, I don't see how he'll say no. And if you read what's actually in project 2025, I promise you it's even worse than what the media says.

Besides, since when has it ever been a good thing for the President to make the Justice department more loyal to his party? Trump says all this stuff about being a dictator on day one. He's trying to claim all this power while saying that he'll immediately give it up. But this is exactly what he said in 2016, and he refused to give up the presidency.

I care about the economy just as much as the next guy, probably a little bit more. Does that mean I'll listen to any economist they bring on CNN? Hell no. (I don't even watch CNN lol) It's really easy for politicians and political media (on both sides) to twist economic arguments to their own advantage, and so whenever I hear someone mention the economy and the president at the same time, I tend to plug my ears. That goes for Biden too. That being said, the one thing I've learned after doing a lot of my own research through non-political sources is that economic policy takes a long time to start working, and that it's not a catch-all. I really do think that a lot of the bad stuff we've seen under Biden comes from Trump's policies only now taking effect, but I can't totally say that for sure, and like I said it's not the main thrust of my argument.",lrw9uyq

This is the first sentence and it's already ridiculous. Donald Trump and JD Vance built their entire campaign on lying about immigrant crimes. 

>One thing i also noticed, the left generally really look down their nose at Trump voters and I find that to be a tell. They really actually think they are better than these dumb farmer rednecks, it tells me all I need to know about them

No, we look down on Trump supporters for their blatant and clear racism and sexism. Even if they're not actively doing racist or sexist things they think it's okay to support the person running our country doing them. I've said it once I'll say it again you can't be racist and intelligent it just doesn't work. 

>You don't get helped in a big city of lefties, you get jacked

What was the last city you were in? I live in New England and Boston, NYC, Providence all seem to be doing just fine, and get the help they need when they need it. Look at hurricane Sandy years ago.

>I am starting to think most people don't give a fuck about policies or even the truth


Do me a favor and name off a couple of Trump policies he's running his campaign on. Oh yea that's right he doesn't have any he has in his own words ""a concept of a plan"".",lru2y4g
